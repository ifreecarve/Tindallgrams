</header>

<p>MIT currently has plans for suppling a number of different modes for
using their basic orbit determination program. (MIT calls this process
"navigation," so I will, too.) These modes differ in that there is a
variety of types of observational data used during different mission
phases.</p>

<p>In our attempt to simplify the AS-504 spacecraft computer program, we
are reviewing the overall situation to determine that no unnecessary
modes are included. For example, there is no need to perform orbit
navigation while in earth orbit for the lunar mssion or any recognized
contingency situation. This particular orbit navigation mode was to
utilize star/landmark observations along with other earth orbital service 
routines aan special initialization capabilities to determine the
spacecraft state vector prior to the translunar injection maneuver.
Since this program is not required for the lunar mission, MIT will be
directed not to include it in the AS-504 program. Since we do not intend 
to implement any programs especially for AS-207, unless directed
otherwise, it will be dropped from the AS-207 computer program as well,
which means that the CSM will not have the capability of determining
its own orbital elements during that mission.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it will not be possible to satisfy that mission objective
as referenced in TRW document 2132-H008-R8-000, "Mission Requirements
for Apollo Spacecraft Development Mission AS-207/208" dated March 7,
1966, classified Confidential.</p>
