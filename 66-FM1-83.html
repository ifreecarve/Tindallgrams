</header>

<p>The purpose of this memorandum is to inform you of two special features
of the Apollo spacecraft rendezvous guidance computer program you may
not be aware of since we just added them to the system.</p>

<p>First of all, you recall that both spacecraft--the CSM and the LEM--
have rendezvous guidance systems. In order for the computers to determine 
what maneuvers are required to bring about rendezvous, the basic
thing each of the computers needs is the state vectors--that is, orbital
elements--of both vehicles. Up until now, all thought has apparently
been given to the LEM program. Since the CSM is supposed to be passive,
all radar data is used to update the <span class="ul">LEM</span> state vector, based on the
assumption that the CSM it is tracking is in a well known, unchanging
orbit. Also, as the LEM makes maneuvers, the guidance system senses
them and so there is no need for a pilot input to the computer to inform 
it that they were made. However, when we consider what's going
on in the CSM, or in the LEM during a CSM rescue, this doesn't look so
hot.</p>

<p>First of all, the computer may really have a better defined state vector
for its oen spacecraft, making it more desirable to update the state vector 
of the other vehicle. Therefore, pilot control is needed over which
spacecraft state vector should be updated based on the radar and optical
observations. This will allow the pilot to exercise his best judgment
as opposed to providing some sort of autonmatic logic built into the computer 
program. Also, if the other vehicle maneuvers, the computer won't
know it unless informed by some external source, like the crew. For this
reason and others, it is also necessary to include in both the CSM and
LEM computer programs the capability for the pilot to input to the computer 
the fact that the other spacecraft is making a maneuver such that
it can be taken into account in maintaining the best current state vector
of each spacecraft in each spacecraft's computer.</p>

<p>Accordingly, both of these options are being provided; that is, the crew
will, inform the computer which spacecraft state vector should be updated
and he shall also input to the computer all necessary information when the
other vehicle makes a maneuver. Associated with this latter capability
is the need to assure that the observational data is not improperly used.
Therefore, in order to avoid complex and sophisticated computer logic, we
have decided to again utilize the crew's capability to understand the
situation and control the computer processing in the following way. The
pilot will interrupt the computer program at the time it is planned that
the other vehicle will make the maneuver, which will cause the computer
to reject all tracking data until the actual Î”V of the maneuver is input.
He will have to get this information by voice from the other spacecraft
after the manneuver is executed, of course. This procedure will assure
that the quantities which are input are the most accurate available and
should assure that the observational data is used properly.</p>
