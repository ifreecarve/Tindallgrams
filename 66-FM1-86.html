    <div class="subject">SUBJECT: No special program available for targeting the CSM plane change in lunar orbit</div>
</header>

<p>As I understand it, it is currently planned to make a plane change with
the CSM in lunar orbit within the last several revolutions prior to LEM
ascent. The purpose of this maneuver is to optimize the sharing of maneuver 
(propulsion) requirements between the CSM and the LEM.</p>

<p>This memorandum is to inform you that there is no computer program currently 
planned for either the CSM or LEM spacecraft computer to carry
out the targeting for this CSM plane change. In other words, in finalizing 
the onboard computer program requirements for the AS-504 mission,
we are assuming that the targeting for this maneuver will be carried out
by some source external to the computer, such as pre-mission planning in
the form of crew charts or from the MCC in real time.</p>

<p>Of course, the programs needed to execute this maneuver will be available,
although not provided specifically for it.</p>
